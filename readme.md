# Past local election data
## have there been possible mistakes in regional elections in Poland in the past?
In 2025 Polish presidential election, there were reported incidents of voting stations mistakenly assigning votes in 2nd round of the election. In some cases, like commision 95 in Krak√≥w, Rafal Trzaskowski's votes were assigned to Karol Nawrocki, and vice versa. 

While in a presidential election it didn't have any impact on the final result, this scenario raises a question about past regional elections.
Have there been cases of an accidental election win in second round of voting for local mayors and presidents in the past?
